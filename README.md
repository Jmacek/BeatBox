# Beatbox

Welcome to Beatbox! This repo contains three directories:

beatbox-frontend: a React TypeScript application for streaming music.
beatbox-backend: a Go server application for streaming music.
design: the design files for the Beatbox application.

Each of the directories has its own README with detailed information on the respective folder.

Please note that this repository is intended for educational purposes only and is not meant to be run in a production environment. It may not have all the necessary features and security measures for a production-ready application. Use it as a reference or for learning purposes and not as a base for any production system.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the directory of the application you wish to run: cd beatbox-frontend or cd beatbox-backend
* Follow the instructions in the README of the respective directory to set up and run the application.

## Syncing the front-end and back-end

If you're running on localhost or wherever, you'll need to modify `beatbox-frontend/src/configs/constants.ts` API_URL to point to the appropriate backend server

## Contribution

Please follow the respective README file in each directory for the contribution guidelines.
